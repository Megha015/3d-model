DALLE Backend with React Three Fiber and Tailwind CSS.

This project utilizes DALLE for backend AI calls. Here are the steps to set up the project:

Client Setup:
Create a new React project using Vite:

bash
Copy code
npm create vite@latest -- --template react client
Move into the client directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath valtio react-color framer-motion
Install Tailwind CSS:

bash
Copy code
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
In the tailwind.config.js file, copy-paste the template path.

Add the required lines in index.css at the top, just before :root;.

Copy-paste the contents of Public within the client folder. Also, copy the contents of Assets and Config within SRC.

Replace the contents of index.css with the code from the gist.

Open App.jsx and use the provided code.

Utilize the SketchPicker from the react-color library for color options.

Use Valtio for animations.

Backend Setup:
Create a new folder named SERVER and set up a complete backend using Node.js to make AI calls work. The backend will make API calls to DALLE to generate the image.

Initialize npm in the server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm init -y
Update the start script in package.json to keep the index file running as changes are made:

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon index.js"
}
Add the "type": "module" field to package.json to enable modern import and export statements:

json
Copy code
"type": "module"
Install the required dependencies inside the server:

bash
Copy code
npm install cloudinary cors dotenv express mongoose nodemon openai
Create index.js and route.dalle.js files.

Get the API key from OpenAI API Keys. Create a new API key and securely store it in the Visual Studio Code by creating a new .env file inside the routes folder.

In dalle.routes.js, connect the API_KEY with the server.

Deployment:
To deploy the backend server, follow these steps:

Go to Render.com.

Click "Add new," then select "Web Service," and give it a name.

Set the "Start command" as "npm run start" for the server to start running.

This completes the setup for the DALLE Backend with React Three Fiber and Tailwind CSS project. Feel free to explore and enhance the application further. For any questions or feedback, please refer to the provided YouTube link for additional details. Happy coding!
